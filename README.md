This is a personal project for creating a telegram bot that helps with converting imperial into metric units. It is also able to retrieve the previous day's currency rate for Malaysia Ringgit, Australian Dollars, Hong Kong Dollars, and US Dollars.

At the moment, this bot is only callable when it is initialized locally.
